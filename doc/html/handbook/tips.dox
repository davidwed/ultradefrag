/**
 * @page Tips Tips and Tricks
 *
 * <h1>Initial Usage</h1>
 * Freshly used drives can be defragmented immediately, any drive,
 * which has been in use for a long time without maintenance, should
 * be checked for consistency first.
 * <dl>
 * <dt>CHKDSK {Drive:} /F /V</dt>
 * <dd>this checks the drive and repairs it if needed</dd>
 * <dt>CHKDSK {Drive:} /R /F /V</dt>
 * <dd>this checks the drive, repairs it and collects lost clusters
 * if needed (takes quite long, but is the safest)</dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <h1>Flash and SSD Drives</h1>
 * The use of disk defragmentation is not recommended on
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory">flash memory</a>
 * or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive">solid-state drives</a>
 * (SSD), as it may reduce the lifespan of the drive. As flash memory does not rely
 * on physical movement to read the drive, random file access is much faster
 * than a mechanical hard drive, so defragmentation is not necessary.
 *
 * On the other hand, flash drives defragmentation
 * increases their potential for recovery as mentioned
 * <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ultradefrag/forums/forum/709672/topic/3750353">in our forum</a>.
 *
 * <h1>Floppy Drives</h1>
 * Floppy drives defragmentation is not recommended, because it
 * always reduces the lifespan of the floppies.
 *
 * <h1>Performance Considerations</h1>
 * It is recommended to exclude as much files as possible from
 * defragmentation - this will dramatically decrease the defragmentation
 * time. Temporary files and archives are usually rarely accessed and
 * may be left fragmented without a noticeable system performance
 * degradation.
 *
 * It is also highly recommended to disable the Windows paging file.
 * It expands RAM, but works much slower therefore highly decreases
 * the system performance. If more RAM is needed than physically
 * installed, setting up additional RAM modules always gives the best
 * result.
 *
 * <h1>Parallel Processing</h1>
 * You can process multiple volumes simultaneously, but only if they
 * are located on different hard-disks.
 * Processing multiple volumes located on the same hard-disk will
 * increase processing time significantly.
 *
 * Example:
 * - Hard-disk 1 contains volumes C: and D:
 * - Hard-disk 2 contains volumes G: and H:
 *
 * You can start one UltraDefrag session to process volumes C: and D:
 * and a second separate session to process volumes G: and H:\n
 * This will result in less time needed to process all four volumes.
 * If both hard-disks are occupied in a similar way the time will be
 * reduced to about 50% compared to the time needed for all volumes to be
 * processed one after the other.
 *
 * <h1>Caveats</h1>
 * Highly fragmented volumes will have to be defragmented several
 * times until you will see an improvement.
