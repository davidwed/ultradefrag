/**
 * @page Boot Boot Time Defragmentation
 *
 * UltraDefrag also includes a new mode that allows you to run it
 * at boot time in a manner similar to chkdsk. This is known as a
 * native application. It provides the ability to defragment any
 * system file. Including page file, registry hives, hiberfil.sys
 * file and any other files locked by the system or applications. Native
 * UltraDefrag runs before any file locking, therefore it can
 * process them as ordinary files.
 * <a href="http://ultradefrag.sourceforge.net/screenshots.html">View screenshots...</a>
 *
 * If the boot time defragmenter is enabled, it will run
 * at every boot. Note that you will have a chance
 * to exit immediately, just press any key when the appropriate
 * prompt is displayed. If no key is pressed during this
 * delay, the boot time script will be executed.
 *
 * You can always stop the volume analysis/defragmentation by pressing
 * the Pause/Break key on the keyboard.
 *
 * The following restrictions exist for the boot time scans:
 * - You may not scan encrypted volumes. This is because lsass.exe, the component
 * of the operating system that reads encrypted volumes, is still not loaded
 * at a time of the native applications execution.
 * - In Windows Safe Mode the program cannot display text on the boot screen.
 * UltraDefrag checks for boot options and returns immediately, if the
 * Safe Mode flag has been found.
 *
 * The boot time defragmenter can be enabled/disabled either from 
 * the main GUI window or by typing boot-on/boot-off commands in
 * the command prompt.
 *
 * <h1>Boot Time Modes</h1>
 * The boot time defragmenter can be executed in two modes:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>Boot time script</dt>
 * <dd>The boot time script consists of the disk defragmentation commands,
 * ancillary commands and comments.
 * It is located at \%windir\%\\system32\\ud-boot-time.cmd.
 * To edit this file execute boot-config at the command prompt or simply click
 * the Script button of the UltraDefrag Configuration dialog.
 *
 * The boot time script simplifies also the use of UltraDefrag on
 * computers running Windows 98. After installing Windows XP as a second
 * operating system, UltraDefrag may be installed too. After adding the
 * shutdown command to the boot time script you may simply boot the XP system
 * (which requires much less resources at boot time!) and safely leave your
 * computer. It will be shut down automatically after the job is completed.
 *
 * To abort the script execution and enter the interactive mode immediately
 * hit <b>ESC</b> at any time during boot time script processing.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>Interactive mode</dt>
 * <dd>When the exit command is missing in the boot time script UltraDefrag
 * runs in interactive mode after the last script command is executed.
 * UltraDefrag displays the following command prompt and waits
 * for the users input:
 *
@verbatim
Interactive mode:
Type 'help' for list of supported commands.

#
@endverbatim
 *
 * All commands displaying long lists (help, history, man, set, type) are splitting them into pages in interactive mode.
 * </dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * <h1>Available Boot Time Commands</h1>
 * <dl>
 * <dt>; or #</dt>
 * <dd>Lines starting with one of these characters are treated as comments.</dd>
 * <dt>\@</dt>
 * <dd>Do not show the command line preceded by the at-sign on the screen.
 * By default the command line is displayed on the screen.</dd>
 * <dt>boot-on</dt>
 * <dd>Turn on the boot time defragmentation to be executed at every boot.</dd>
 * <dt>boot-off</dt>
 * <dd>Turn off the boot time defragmentation. It prevents them from being
 * executed at next reboots. Until you will enable them manually through
 * UltraDefrag Configuration dialog or boot-on.cmd script.</dd>
 * <dt>call</dt>
 * <dd>Similar to the DOS command.
 * Executes the specified script.
 * If no script is specified, the default boot time script is executed.</dd>
 * <dt>echo</dt>
 * <dd>Similar to the DOS command.
 * Display a message, empty line, enable/disable showing the command line on the screen
 * or display the status of showing the command line.</dd>
 * <dt>exit</dt>
 * <dd>Similar to the DOS command.
 * Break the boot time program execution and return the specified error code or zero.</dd>
 * <dt>help</dt>
 * <dd>Show a list of all available commands.</dd>
 * <dt>history</dt>
 * <dd>Show a list of all manually entered commands.
 * To cycle through the commands use the up/down arrow/cursor keys.</dd>
 * <dt>man</dt>
 * <dd>List or display available manual pages.</dd>
 * <dt>pause</dt>
 * <dd>Pause the script execution for the specified time interval (in milliseconds, 2147483647 maximum)
 * or till a key is pressed, if no duration is specified.
 * For example, the command <b>pause 1000</b> will pause execution for one second.</dd>
 * <dt>reboot</dt>
 * <dd>Reboot the computer.</dd>
 * <dt>set</dt>
 * <dd>Similar to the DOS command.
 * List, set and clear environment variables.
 * For further information about the supported variables consult the @ref Console page.</dd>
 * <dt>shutdown</dt>
 * <dd>Halt the computer.</dd>
 * <dt>type</dt>
 * <dd>Similar to the DOS command.
 * Display the contents of a file, the default is the boot time script.</dd>
 * <dt>udefrag</dt>
 * <dd>This is the native equivalent of the UltraDefrag command line tool.
 * The following keys are supported: -la, -l, -a, -o, --all, --all-fixed.
 * Multiple drive letters on a single command line are allowed.<br/>
 * You can specify <b>absolute paths</b> to process single files or directories.
 * Paths including spaces must be enclosed by double quotes (").
 * To specify multiple paths separate them by spaces.<br/>
 * Example:
 * udefrag "C:\Documents and Settings" C:\\WINDOWS\\WindowsUpdate.log</dd>
 * </dl>
 *
 * When UltraDefrag encounters the wrong syntax it shows an appropriate
 * message on the screen and continues the script execution.
 *
 * For further information about the command switches and variables consult the @ref Console page.
 *
 * <h1>Boot time script example</h1>
 * The following script is used by default:
