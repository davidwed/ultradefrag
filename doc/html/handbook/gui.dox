/**
 * @page GUI Graphical Interface
 *
 * The UltraDefrag GUI consists of a single resizable window.
 * <a href="http://ultradefrag.sourceforge.net/screenshots.html">View screenshots...</a>
 *
 * <b>List of Volumes</b>\n
 * The top part of the window contains a full list of volumes
 * available for defragmentation. Each line of the list contains
 * volume name, type of filesystem, a total amount of space,
 * an amount of free space and, finally, a percent of free space
 * on the volume.
 *
 * Fixed drives are marked by @htmlonly <img src="fixed.png"> @endhtmlonly,
 * removable drives - by @htmlonly <img src="removable.png"> @endhtmlonly.
 *
 * Click Rescan drives button or type Ctrl+R to refresh the list of volumes.
 * Check the Skip removable media box to prevent removable disks like floppies and USB-sticks
 * from being displayed in the list.
 *
 * Multiple volumes can be selected in the list. In this case UltraDefrag
 * will process them in series. The rules of the selection are the same as
 * in Windows Explorer.
 *
 * <b>Cluster Map</b>\n
 * It represents the volume clusters by little colored squares.
 * Colors have the following meaning:
 *
 * @htmlonly
 *  <TABLE BORDER="0">
 *    <TR>
 *      <TD><img src="Fragmented.png"></TD><TD>Fragmented</TD>
 *      <TD STYLE="padding: 10px"></TD>
 *      <TD><img src="NotFragmented.png"></TD><TD>Not Fragmented</TD>
 *      <TD STYLE="padding: 10px"></TD>
 *      <TD><img src="Compressed.png"></TD><TD>Compressed</TD>
 *    </TR>
 *    <TR>
 *      <TD><img src="Directory.png"></TD><TD>Directory</TD>
 *      <TD STYLE="padding: 10px"></TD>
 *      <TD><img src="System.png"></TD><TD>System (Locked)</TD>
 *      <TD STYLE="padding: 10px"></TD>
 *      <TD><img src="MFT.png"></TD><TD>MFT</TD>
 *    </TR>
 *    <TR>
 *      <TD><img src="Temporary.png"></TD><TD>Temporary</TD>
 *      <TD STYLE="padding: 10px"></TD>
 *      <TD></TD><TD></TD>
 *      <TD STYLE="padding: 10px"></TD>
 *      <TD><img src="FreeSpace.png"></TD><TD>Free Space</TD>
 *    </TR>
 *  </TABLE>
 * @endhtmlonly
 *
 * When there are two different colors assigned to the same item, the
 * darker one marks objects above the size threshold, if one
 * is set. Dark magenta represents the master file table (MFT),
 * light magenta - space reserved for the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/174619">MFT expansion</a>.
 * The cyan color represents space temporarily allocated by Windows. 
 *
 * Note that files excluded from the defragmentation process
 * are never treated as fragmented. Because trash should not
 * take an attention.
 *
 * <b>Disk Defragmentation Control</b>\n
 * Click Analyse button or type Ctrl+A to start the volume analysis. 
 * Click Defragment button or type Ctrl+D to start the volume defragmentation.
 * Click Optimize button or type Ctrl+C to start the volume optimization.
 * Use Stop button or Ctrl+S hotkeys to stop the currently running disk
 * defragmentation/analysis job.
 *
 * Note that window cannot be resized during the volume processing.
 *
 * The progress and status bars located in the bottom part of the
 * window are displaying the progress of the currently running job.
 * Note that selecting a different volume
 * will cause the progress bar to disappear.

 * Click Report button or type Ctrl+F to open the file
 * fragmentation report. Click Settings button or type Ctrl+T to open
 * the UltraDefrag Configuration dialog. About button (hotkey - F1) opens
 * a little window containing the most important information about the program.
 *
 * <b>Shutting Down or Hibernating the Computer after a Job</b>\n
 * If the Shut down PC after a job box is checked UltraDefrag
 * will automatically shut down the computer after a job completion.
 * Note that your system and hardware configuration must support
 * shutdown and power off, otherwise Windows may reboot your PC
 * or even do quite nothing. Therefore test this mode before using it
 * at regular basis.
 *
 * Instead of an automatic shutdown, an automatic hibernation
 * may be used. Open the UltraDefrag Configuration dialog, click 
 * Options button inside the Graphical interface section and set
 * hibernate_instead_of_shutdown = 1. Note that your system must
 * support hibernation and it must be turned on. Otherwise Windows
 * will display a message box containing a brief error description
 * and system will not be switched to hibernation mode.
 *
 * <h1>Configuring</h1>
 * Click the Settings button in UltraDefrag GUI to open 
 * the UltraDefrag Configuration dialog.
 * Also it can be launched from the Start menu. 
 * Use Start > Programs > UltraDefrag > Preferences shortcut.
 * A single UltraDefrag Configuration dialog is logically divided
 * into three sections.
 *
 * <b>Graphical Interface</b>\n
 * Click Font button to select a font for GUI applications rendering.
 * The default font is Courier New, 9. The Options button opens the 
 * guiopts.lua placed in /options subfolder of the program's directory.
 * The Help button opens this section of the handbook.
 * If you have a local copy of documentation installed, the
 * program will use it. Otherwise the same page will be
 * loaded from the project's web site.
 *
 * GUI options have the same meaning as environment variables
 * accepted by UltraDefrag command line tool.
 *
 * Note that you must specify paths in filters with double back
 * slashes instead of the single. For example:
 *
 *
@verbatim
ex_filter = "MyDocs\\Music\\mp3\\Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers"
@endverbatim
 *
 * The following script is used by default:
 *
@verbatim
-- UltraDefrag GUI options

-- Note that you must specify paths in filters
-- with double back slashes instead of the single ones.
-- For example:
-- ex_filter = "MyDocs\\Music\\mp3\\Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers"

in_filter = ""
ex_filter = "system volume information;temp;recycle"
sizelimit = ""
fragments_threshold = 0
refresh_interval = 100
time_limit = ""

disable_reports = 0

-- set dbgprint_level to DETAILED for reporting a bug,
-- for normal operation set it to NORMAL or an empty string

dbgprint_level = "NORMAL"

-- set hibernate_instead_of_shutdown to 1, if you prefer to hibernate the system
-- after a job is done instead of shutting it down, otherwise set it to 0

hibernate_instead_of_shutdown = 0

-- set show_shutdown_check_confirmation_dialog to 1 to display the confirmation dialog
-- for shutdown or hibernate, otherwise set it to 0

show_shutdown_check_confirmation_dialog = 1

-- seconds_for_shutdown_rejection sets the delay for the user to cancel
-- the shutdown or hibernate execution, default is 60 seconds

seconds_for_shutdown_rejection = 60

-- cluster map options (restart required to take effect):
-- the size of the block, in pixels; default value is 4

map_block_size = 4

-- the grid line width, in pixels; default value is 1

grid_line_width = 1

-- set disable_latest_version_check parameter to 1
-- to disable the automatic check for the latest available
-- version of the program during startup

disable_latest_version_check = 0

-- window coordinates etc.

-- set scale_by_dpi parameter to 0
-- to not scale the buttons and text according to the
-- screens DPI settings

scale_by_dpi = 1

-- set restore_default_window_size parameter to 1
-- to restore default window size on the next startup

restore_default_window_size = 0
@endverbatim
 *
 * It does make sense to set <b>grid_line_width = 0</b>,
 * if you set <b>map_block_size = 1</b> to be able to use the whole
 * size of the cluster map.\n
 * This is especially useful, if you have drives of sizes of 500GB and more.
 *
 * <b>Windows Boot Time Scan</b>\n
 * This section controls the boot time defragmenter. It is disabled
 * in portable packages. 
 * Check Enable box to turn on the boot time defragmenter.
 * Click Script button to open the boot time script for editing.
 * Click Help button to open the appropriate section of the Handbook.
 *
 * <b>Reports</b>\n
 * This section controls the file fragmentation reports options.
