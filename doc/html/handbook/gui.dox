/**
 * @page GUI Graphical Interface
 *
 * The UltraDefrag GUI consists of a single fixed-size window.
 * <a href="http://ultradefrag.sourceforge.net/doxy-doc/html/Screenshots.html">View screenshots...</a>
 *
 * <b>List of Volumes</b>\n
 * The top part of the window contains a full list of volumes
 * available for defragmentation. Each line of the list contains
 * volume name, type of filesystem, a total amount of space,
 * an amount of free space and, finally, a percent of free space
 * on the volume.
 *
 * Fixed drives are marked by @htmlonly <img src="fixed.ico"> @endhtmlonly,
 * removable drives - by @htmlonly <img src="removable.ico"> @endhtmlonly.
 *
 * Click Rescan drives button or type Ctrl+R to refresh the list of volumes.
 * Check the Skip removable media box to prevent removable disks like floppies and USB-sticks
 * from being displayed in the list.
 *
 * <b>Cluster Map</b>\n
 * It represents the volume clusters by a little colored squares.
 * Colors have the following meaning:
 *
 * @image html legend.png
 *
 * When they are two colors assigned to the same item, the
 * darker one marks objects above the size threshold if one
 * is set. The cyan color represents space temporarily allocated
 * by system. 
 *
 * Note that files excluded from the defragmentation process
 * are never treated as fragmented. Because trash should not
 * take an attention.
 *
 * <b>Disk Defragmentation Control</b>\n
 * Click Analyse button or type Ctrl+A to start the volume analysis. 
 * Click Defragment button or type Ctrl+D to start the volume defragmentation.
 * Click Compact button or type Ctrl+C to start the volume optimization.
 * Use Stop button or Ctrl+S hotkeys to stop the currently running disk
 * defragmentation/analysis job.
 *
 * The progress and status bars located in the bottom part of the
 * window are displaying the progress of the currently running job.
 * Note that selecting a different volume
 * will cause the progress bar to disappear.

 * Click Fragmented button or type (Ctrl+F) to open the file
 * fragmentation report. Click Settings button or type Ctrl+T to open
 * the UltraDefrag GUI Configurator. About button (hotkey - F1) opens
 * a little window containing the most important information about the program.
 *
 * <b>Shutting Down or Hibernating the Computer after a Job</b>\n
 * If the Shut down PC after a job box is checked UltraDefrag
 * will automatically shut down the computer after a job completion.
 * Note that your system and hardware configuration must support
 * shutdown and power off, otherwise Windows may reboot your PC
 * or even do quite nothing. Therefore test this mode before using it
 * at regular basis.
 *
 * Instead of an automatic shutdown, an automatic hibernation
 * may be used. Open the Configurator, click Options button
 * inside the Graphical interface section and set
 * hibernate_instead_of_shutdown = 1. Note that your system must
 * support hibernation and it must be turned on. Otherwise Windows
 * will display a message box containing a brief error description
 * and system will not be switched to hibernation mode.
 *
 * <h1>Configuring</h1>
 * Click the Settings button in UltraDefrag GUI to open the Configurator.
 * Also it can be launched from the Start menu. 
 * Use Start > Programs > UltraDefrag > Preferences shortcut.
 * A single Configurator's window is logically divided into three sections.
 *
 * <b>Graphical Interface</b>\n
 * Click Font button to select a font for GUI applications rendering.
 * The default font is Courier New, 9. The Options button opens the 
 * guiopts.lua placed in /options subfolder of the program's directory.
 * The Help button opens this section of the handbook.
 * If you have a local copy of documentation installed, the
 * Configurator will use it. Otherwise the same page will be
 * loaded from the project's web site.
 *
 * GUI options have the same meaning as environment variables
 * accepted by UltraDefrag command line tool.
 *
 * Note that you must specify paths in filters with double back
 * slashes instead of the single. For example:
 *
 *
@verbatim
ex_filter = "MyDocs\\Music\\mp3\\Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers"
@endverbatim
 *
 * The following script is used by default:
 *
@verbatim
-- UltraDefrag GUI options

in_filter = ""
ex_filter = "system volume information;temp;recycler;recycled"
sizelimit = ""
fragments_threshold = 0
refresh_interval = 500
time_limit = ""

disable_reports = 0
dbgprint_level = ""

-- set this parameter to 1 if you prefer to hibernate system
-- after a job instead of shutting them down, otherwise set it to 0

hibernate_instead_of_shutdown = 0
@endverbatim
 *
 * <b>Windows Boot Time Scan</b>\n
 * This section controls the boot time defragmenter. It is disabled
 * in portable packages. 
 * Check Enable box to turn on the boot time defragmenter.
 * Click Script button to open the boot time script for editing.
 * Click Help button to open the appropriate section of the Handbook.
 *
 * <b>Reports</b>\n
 * This section controls the file fragmentation reports options.
