 * <h1>The Tool-Bar</h1>
 * It consists of the most frequently used commands for easy access.
 *
 * <h1>List of Volumes</h1>
 * The top part of the window contains a full list of volumes
 * available for defragmentation. Each line of the list contains
 * volume name, type of filesystem, total amount of space,
 * amount of free space and, finally, percent of free space
 * on the volume.
 *
 * Fixed drives are marked by @htmlonly <img src="fixed.png"> @endhtmlonly,
 * removable drives - by @htmlonly <img src="removable.png"> @endhtmlonly.
 *
 * Multiple volumes can be selected in the list. In this case UltraDefrag
 * will process them one after the other. The rules for the selection are the same as
 * in Windows Explorer.
 *
 * <h1>Cluster Map</h1>
 * It represents the volume clusters by little colored squares.
 * Colors have the following meaning:
 *
 * @htmlonly
 *  <TABLE BORDER="0">

 *    </TR>
 *  </TABLE>
 * @endhtmlonly
 *
 * When there are two different colors assigned to the same item, the
 * darker one marks objects above the size threshold, if one
 * is set. Dark magenta represents the master file table (MFT),
 * light magenta - space reserved for the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/174619">MFT expansion</a>.
 * The cyan color represents space temporarily allocated by Windows. 
 *
 * Note that files excluded from the defragmentation process
 * are never treated as fragmented. Because trash should not
 * get our attention.
 *
 * <h1>When done</h1>
 * If any of the actions except <b>None</b> is checked, UltraDefrag
 * will automatically perform that action after the job completes.
 *
 * Note that your system and hardware configuration must support
 * shutdown and power off, otherwise Windows may reboot your PC
 * or even do nothing. Therefore test this mode before using it
 * at a regular basis.
 *
 * Note that your system must support the selected suspend mode
 * and it must be turned on. Otherwise Windows
 * will display a message box containing a brief error description
 * and the system will not be switched into any suspend mode.
 *
 * <h1>Configuring</h1>
 * The default font is Courier New, 9.
 *
 * GUI options have the same meaning as the environment variables
 * accepted by the UltraDefrag command line tool.
 *
 * Note that you must specify paths in filters with double back
 * slashes instead of a single one. For example:
 *
 *
@verbatim
ex_filter = "MyDocs\\Music\\mp3\\Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers"
@endverbatim
 *
 * The following script is used by default:
 *
@verbatim
-- UltraDefrag GUI options

-- Note that you must specify paths in filters
-- with double back slashes instead of the single ones.
-- For example:
-- ex_filter = "MyDocs\\Music\\mp3\\Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers"

in_filter = ""
ex_filter = "system volume information;temp;recycle"
sizelimit = ""
fragments_threshold = 0
refresh_interval = 100
time_limit = ""

disable_reports = 0

-- set dbgprint_level to DETAILED for reporting a bug,
-- for normal operation set it to NORMAL or an empty string

dbgprint_level = "NORMAL"

-- set dry_run parameter to 1 for defragmentation algorithm testing,
-- no actual data moves will be performed on disk in this case

dry_run = 0

-- seconds_for_shutdown_rejection sets the delay for the user to cancel
-- the hibernate, logoff, reboot or shutdown execution, default is 60 seconds

seconds_for_shutdown_rejection = 60

-- cluster map options (restart required to take effect):
-- the size of the block, in pixels; default value is 4

map_block_size = 4

-- the grid line width, in pixels; default value is 1

grid_line_width = 1

-- grid line color, in RGB format; default value is (0;0;0)
-- all color components should be in range 0-255
-- (0;0;0) means black; (255;255;255) - white

grid_color_r = 0
grid_color_g = 0
grid_color_b = 0

-- set disable_latest_version_check parameter to 1
-- to disable the automatic check for the latest available
-- version of the program during startup

disable_latest_version_check = 0

-- window coordinates etc.

-- set scale_by_dpi parameter to 0
-- to not scale the buttons and text according to the
-- screens DPI settings

scale_by_dpi = 1

-- set restore_default_window_size parameter to 1
-- to restore default window size on the next startup

restore_default_window_size = 0
@endverbatim
 *
 * It does make sense to set <b>grid_line_width = 0</b>,
 * if you set <b>map_block_size = 1</b> to be able to use the whole
 * size of the cluster map.\n
 * This is especially useful, if you have drives of sizes of 500GB and more.
