 * @page Scheduler UltraDefrag Scheduler
 * The command line version of UltraDefrag may be run out of
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_Scheduler">system scheduled tasks</a>.
 * The process of adding a scheduled task instance of UltraDefrag is simplified
 * throuth a utility called UltraDefrag Scheduler.
 * <a href="http://ultradefrag.sourceforge.net/screenshots.html">View screenshots...</a>
 *
 * The simple gui has 4 settings:
 * - Whether to run Ultra Defrag every day (Daily) or only certain days of the week (Weekly).
 * - The time of day to run the task.
 * - The letter of the drive to defragment.
 * - Days of the week to defrag if Weekly is selected.
 *
 * Multiple volumes can be selected in the list. In this case UltraDefrag
 * will process them in series. The rules of the selection are the same as
 * in Windows Explorer.
 *
 * Scheduler can be launched from the Start menu. Use Start > Programs > UltraDefrag > Scheduler
 * shortcut. To browse list of all scheduled tasks use the following menu:
 * Start > Settings > Control Panel > Scheduled Tasks.
 *
 * UltraDefrag Scheduler requires comctl32.dll module version 4.70 or higher to run, therefore
 * you will be able to execute it on Windows 2000 and later systems.
 *
 * Currently Scheduler is not included in the portable version of the program.
