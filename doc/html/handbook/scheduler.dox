/**
 * @page Scheduled Defragmentation
 *
 * The completely automatic disk defragmentation can be easily set
 * through standard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_Scheduler">Windows Task Scheduler</a>.
 *
 * I'm using the following scheduled tasks personally on my system:
 *
 * - Every 30 minutes:
 * @code
 * cmd.exe /C "set UD_IN_FILTER="%APPDATA%\Mozilla" && udefrag %APPDATA%"
 * @endcode
 *
 * - Every day:
 * @code
 * cmd.exe /C "set UD_IN_FILTER="%APPDATA%\Google\GoogleEarth" && udefrag %APPDATA%"
 * @endcode
 *
 * - Every week:
 * @code
 * cmd.exe /C "set UD_IN_FILTER="%often_accessed_folders%" && udefrag --all-fixed"
 * @endcode
 *
 * - Every two months:
 * @code
 * cmd.exe /C "udefrag --all-fixed"
 * @endcode
 *
 * This scheme runs automatically and saves a lot of my time, because I have
 * no need to start defragmenter manually anymore.
 *
 * Visit <a href="http://ultradefrag.wikispaces.com/">ultradefrag.wikispaces.com</a>
