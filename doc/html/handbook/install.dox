/**
 * @page Installation Installation
 *
 * To obtain the latest version of the program please visit the 
 * <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ultradefrag/files/">project's download page</a>.
 *
 * There are two different types of binaries available for download:
 * - Full-featured installers. They contain all of the program features,
 * but require installation therefore cannot be used directly from USB sticks.
 * - Portable packages. Download it, unpack it and use without an installation. 
 * Copy it on an USB stick and you will be able to use UltraDefrag everywhere by simply
 * running it from there. Note that boot time defragmenter is missing from the portable 
 * packages, but all other features are included. 
 * You can find more information about portable applications
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_application">here</a>.
 *
 * The UltraDefrag Micro Edition is a lightweight version of the program containing only the command line tool
 * and the boot time defragmenter.
 * It is intended to be used from the console only.
 * 
 * <span style="color: darkred">
 * You must have a 64-bit version of Windows to run the 64-bit versions of the program.
 * </span>
 *
 * <span style="color: darkred">
 * The IA-64 version was never tested by the authors. 
 * It requires the Intel Itanium processor and an appropriate 64-bit edition of Windows.
 * </span>
 *
 * <span style="color: darkred">
 * You must be an administrator to install and run UltraDefrag
 * </span>
 *
 * Note that UltraDefrag installs into the Windows directory. This is by design,
 * because it highly simplifies the program development.
 * Moreover, it is impossible to run the boot time defragmenter without having its
 * files inside the System32 directory.
 *
 * <h1>Silent Installation</h1>
 * UltraDefrag can be installed in silent mode by adding the <b>/S</b> switch to the installer's command line
 * at the command prompt. In this case no dialogs will be shown and the program will be installed 
 * to the hard drive completely with all the features enabled. 
 *
 * The following additional command line switches are supported:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>/LANG</dt>
 * <dd>Select the language to be installed. For example, 
 * use <b>/LANG="German"</b> to install the German language pack.<br/>
