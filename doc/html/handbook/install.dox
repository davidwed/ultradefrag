/**
 * @page Installation Installation
 *
 * To obtain the latest version of the program visit please the 
 * <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ultradefrag/files/">project's download page</a>.
 *
 * There are two different types of binaries available for download:
 * - Full-featured installers. They contain all of the program features,
 * but requires an installation therefore cannot be used directly from the USB sticks.
 * - Portable packages. Download it, unpack it somewhere and use without an installation. 
 * Write it on USB stick and you will be able to use UltraDefrag everywhere by simply
 * running it from there. Note that boot time defragmenter is missing in the portable 
 * packages, but the most remaining features are working fine there. To configure the portable
 * package run the LanguageSelector.exe tool and select your preferred language.
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_application">Here</a> is more information
 * about portable applications.
 *
 * The UltraDefrag Micro Edition is a lightweight version of the program containing only the command line tool
 * and the boot time defragmenter.
 * 
 * <span style="color: darkred">
 * You must have a 64-bit version of Windows to run the
 * 64-bit versions of the program. IA-64 version was never tested by the authors. 
 * It requires Intel Itanium processor and an appropriate 64-bit edition of Windows.
 * </span>
 *
 * <span style="color: darkred">
 * You must be an administrator to install and run UltraDefrag
 * </span>
 *
 * <span style="color: darkred">
 * You must disable your virus detection software 
 * before using UltraDefrag. Any virus scanner 
 * running during the defragmentation extremely slows down this process.
 * </span>
 *
 * Note that UltraDefrag installs to the Windows directory. This is caused by design,
 * because it highly simlifies the program development.
 * Moreover, this is impossible to run the boot time defragmenter without having its
 * files inside the system32 directory.
 *
 * UltraDefrag can be installed in silent mode by adding the /S key to the installer's command 
 * in command prompt. In this case no dialogs will be shown and the program will be installed 
 * to the hard drive completely with all the features enabled. 
 * The /LANG option allows to select the language pack to be installed. For example, 
 * use /LANG=German to install the German language pack.
 *
 * There is also a silent mode in the
 * ununstaller program. Type in comand prompt \%windir\%\\UltraDefrag\\uninstall.exe /S
 * to remove the program from the hard drive automatically without any graphical dialogs.
