/**
 * @page FAQ Frequently Asked Questions
 * <h3>Why configuration files editing is better than one settings window with tabs?</h3>
 * It is much easier and reliable to use 
 * standard Notepad application for
 * configuration files editing.
 *
 * <h3>How can I disable the boot time defragmenter manually?</h3>
 * If something goes wrong and the boot-off script does not work properly, remove the 
 * defrag_native entry from the following system registry parameter manually:
 *
@verbatim
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\BootExecute
@endverbatim
 *
 * <h3>How many differences are between the Ultra Defragmenter and well known MyDefrag (previously JkDefrag) application?</h3>
 * The volume analysis algorithm was generally the same prior to 3.2.0 version of the program. 
 * Since the 3.2.0 version UltraDefrag uses the Ultra Fast NTFS Analysis algorithm. It reads MFT
 * directly and analyzes them to retrieve detailed information about all the files contained
 * on the volume. This algorithm is much faster (approximately 25 times faster).
 *
 * Defragmentation is done in different ways. MyDefrag tries to optimize files placement
 * using original algorithm that is complex enough. On the other hand, UltraDefragmenter
 * was designed to be as fast as possible, therefore it simply tries to move all fragmented
 * files to free space areas. Nothing more. The volume optimization command was added primarily 
 * to enlarge the free space area in the terminal part of the volume for future defragmentation
 * success.
 *
 * The best advantages of UltraDefrag are an ability to defragment system files at
 * boot time and well readable reports. Also UltraDefrag has a handy graphical interface.
 * And is licensed under GPL, and always will be an open source software.
 *
 * The main disadvantage of both applications (UltraDefrag and MyDefrag) is that they
 * are based on MS defragmenting interface that has very ugly implementation. We cannot
 * change them because it is a part of the filesystem drivers (ntfs.sys, fastfat.sys)
 * that are too complex and not open source to modify or replace them.
 *
 * <h3>The progress bar updates irregularly. Why is this?</h3>
 * The progress bar measures disk space, not the number of files. So when few 
 * big files are analysed, the progress bar will increase very fast. 
 * Conversely, when a thousands of small files are analysed, progress will 
 * be relatively slow.
