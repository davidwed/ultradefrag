/**
 * @page Reports File Fragmentation Reports
 *
 * Every time you run a volume analysis, defragmentation or
 * optimization, UltraDefrag produces the file fragmentation
 * report with a full list of fragmented files located on the
 * volume.
 *
 * UltraDefrag saves file fragmentation reports in the
 * following two formats: LuaReport and Plain Text. The first
 * is used by full-featured versions of the program only, the
 * second format is used everywhere to ensure that the report will 
 * be accessible even on machines without any web browser installed.
 *
 * UltraDefrag saves all reports to the root directories of
 * the processed volumes. To open LuaReport click the fraglist.luar
 * file in Explorer or simply click the Report button in the
 * UltraDefrag GUI after a disk defragmentation/analysis job has
 * completed. To open the Plain Text report click the fraglist.txt
 * file in Explorer.
 *
 * When you are opening the LuaReport a single HTML page is
 * generated and opens in your default web browser. It contains a
 * list of fragmented files. Each line contains the number of
 * fragments, filename and a brief comment: [OVR] for files
 * above the size threshold, [DIR] for directories and [CMP]
 * for NTFS compressed files.
 *
 * By default, all files are sorted by the number of fragments
 * in descending order. To change the sorting click the column
 * heading by which to sort the list. Note that it is a slow
 * process (~350 lines/sec on 1.8GHz CPU). Sorting
 * implemented in JavaScript is slow, but very reliable.
 *
 * Each line of the Plain Text report consists of
 * the number of fragments, the file size, the comment 
 * and the name of the file.
 *
 * All files excluded from the defragmentation by filters
 * are excluded from reports too. Trash should not get
 * our attention.
 *
 * <h1>Configuring</h1>
 * All options related to file fragmentation reports are
 * contained in the udreportopts.lua file inside the
 * /options sub-folder of the program's directory.
 *
 * To open this file for editing click its icon in Explorer
 * or simply click the appropriate button in the UltraDefrag 
 * Configuration dialog.
 *
 * The udreportopts.lua file contains parameter-value pairs
 * and comments (they are starting with double dashes).
 * However this file is a real program written in the
 * <a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> programming language.
 *
 * The following configuration is used by default:
