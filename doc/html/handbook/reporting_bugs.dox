 * If you have encountered a bug please submit your report via the
 * <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=969870&group_id=199532&func=browse">bug tracker</a>.
 * The following additional information is always very appreciated:
 *
 * - screen-shots (required for all GUI-related bugs)
 * - debugging information collected by the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896647.aspx">DbgView</a> program
 *
 * Don't forget to check the <b>Capture Win32</b> item of the Capture menu of the DbgView program.
 * Check one of the <b>Log to file</b> items of the <b>File</b> menu to create a log file you can send us.
 *
 * Don't forget to set <b>dbgprint_level = "DETAILED"</b> in the options file, so we get all the information needed.
 * You can revert the change after you have created the debugging package.
 *
 * Note that DbgView cannot capture information from the user mode driver during the Windows boot process.
 * This is a well known DbgView limitation. The latest version of DbgView cannot be used on NT 4.0 either,
 * check <a href="http://doc.sch130.nsc.ru/www.sysinternals.com/ntw2k/freeware/debugview.shtml">this page</a> for an earlier version.
