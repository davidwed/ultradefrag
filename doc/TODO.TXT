The following is Justin Dearing's TODO list for the manual and other technical 
documents included in the upcoming version 1.1.0.
Items to describe:

1.  (DONE) compact command move all files AND defrag fragmented if possible.
2.  (DONE) currently compact don't applied to FAT volumes because directories on them
    isn't moveable. 
3.  (DONE) gui app hot keys:

    Ctrl + A - analyse
    Ctrl + C - compact
    Ctrl + D - defrag
    Ctrl + F - show fragmented
    Ctrl + P - pause
    Ctrl + S - stop
    Ctrl + R - rescan drives
    Ctrl + T - settings
    F1       - about
    Pause    - pause

4.  (DONE) Pause and Stop actions are equal. You can analyse volume once and then
    defrag and/or compact them few times.
5.  (DONE) FAQ must be rewritten in good style
6.  (DONE) Readme.txt must be rewritten in good style
7.  To developers: program has clear and easy to understand code.
8.  Full support for NTFS compressed files.
9.  (DONE) Console command line options description. And nice appearance description.
10. files with size over limit are shown with dark color
11. full description of filter using. patterns are applied to full path. So \temp
    include either temporary files or internet explorer cache.
12. in report - all excluded files are marked with black color
13. (DONE) settings - report encoding - ASCII is useful for Internet explorer and 
    utf-16 for mozilla firefox (better for chinese and japanese)
14. They are versions for all of the supported processor architectures for x64 
    Windows.
15. (DONE) progress bar disappears when you select other drive: it's normal behaviour
16. can analyse and defrag floppies (isn't useful but ...)
17. report - comment column:
    [OVR] - file is over limit
    [DIR] - is directory
    [CMP] - compressed file
18. about report - small size but very useful [should be in future] - generated 
    by driver very fast.
19. (DONE) filter: ignore files greater than: n [Kb | Mb | Gb | Tb]
20. Debug print: normal to view useful messages about analyse / defrag progress;
    detailed to send to an author when error encountered.
21. (DONE) Virus scanner must be stopped.
