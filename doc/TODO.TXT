The following is Justin Dearing's TODO list for the manual and other technical 
documents included in the upcoming version 1.2.2.
Items to describe:

/* maybe we need to use this file as stack  -- Dmitri */
/* Agreed -- Justin */

1. On windows nt 4.0 sysinternals dbgview don't works. Instead of them user can
   find debug messages in c:\dbgprint.log. Size of them is hard limited by 
   512 Kb. When overflow occurs new messages will be written in the beginning of
   the file. In all cases after the last message [End] tag will be written.

2. files encrypted by ntfs filesystem cannot be processed at boot time.
   [because defrag_native.exe starts always before winlogon.exe, therefore
   before lsass.exe]

3. Program settings are accepted in the following order:
   a). default settings (you can find it in /src/dll/udefrag/settings.c)
   b). settings specified by user in configuration dialog (they are saved in
   registry in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\CurrentControlSet\Control\UltraDefrag, because
   keys other than SYSTEM aren't accessible from the native app, because they are
   not loaded by smss.exe yet). NOTE: If user will return to the 'last known 
   good configuration', settings may be lost.
   c). settings listed above can be overwritten using command line keys
   (currently only for udefrag.exe). Overwritten settings will not be saved
   anywhere.

4. Some settings are limited: each filter must contain no more than 4096 
   characters.

5. Describe new options of console application.

6. In version 1.2.4 and later versions cluster map for very small volumes
   can be very inaccurate. P.a., one floppy disk contains 2847 clusters.
   But internally they are represented (in 1.2.4 version of program) 
   by 3640 blocks. Therefore we have one block (3640 / 2847) per cluster 
   plus 794 blocks per the last one. 
   So, the bottom part of the cluster map is invalid.
   If you have no less than 3640 clusters, don't worry about the cluster map.
   This restriction is a small cost for the big modern volumes support.

1. (DONE) add to manual information about bug reporting:
   NOTE: include please in your bug report following data:
   1. If you see 'Blue Screen Of Death' as result of UltraDefrag working 
   then include important parts of messages on them.
   2. In other cases run Sysinternals DebugView before you start UltraDefrag 
   and include in your report last 200 significant messages (or less). 
   You can free download DebugView here:
                 http://www.sysinternals.com
   3. For gui bugs attach screenshot

2. (DONE) Scheduler.NET requires NET Framework 2.0. And provide [small] description 
   about the scheduler and useful features of them.

3. (DONE) UltraDefrag has now full NT 4.0 support.

4. (DONE) Volumes with UDF filesystem (on Vista only) are supported too. User can create 
   UDF volume using 'format volume_letter: /FS:UDF'.

5. (DONE) "I would appreciate direct links from the entries in the suffix column to
   the executables for download. I guess that it would also be clearer if the
   corresponding notes will be positioned on the right side instead of under
   the table." [about supported processors table]

				***

1.  (DONE) compact command move all files AND defrag fragmented if possible.
2.  (DONE) currently compact don't applied to FAT volumes because directories on them
    isn't moveable. 
3.  (DONE) gui app hot keys:

    Ctrl + A - analyse
    Ctrl + C - compact
    Ctrl + D - defrag
    Ctrl + F - show fragmented
    Ctrl + P - pause
    Ctrl + S - stop
    Ctrl + R - rescan drives
    Ctrl + T - settings
    F1       - about
    Pause    - pause

4.  (DONE) Pause and Stop actions are equal. You can analyse volume once and then
    defrag and/or compact them few times.
5.  (DONE) FAQ must be rewritten in good style
6.  (DONE) Readme.txt must be rewritten in good style
7.  (DONE) To developers: program has clear and easy to understand code.
8.  (DONE) Full support for NTFS compressed files.
9.  (DONE) Console command line options description. And nice appearance description.
10. (DONE) files with size over limit are shown with dark color
11. (DONE) full description of filter using. patterns are applied to full path. So \temp
    include either temporary files or internet explorer cache.
12. in report - all excluded files are marked with black color
13. (DONE) settings - report encoding - ASCII is useful for Internet explorer and 
    utf-16 for mozilla firefox (better for chinese and japanese)
14. (DONE) They are versions for all of the supported processor architectures for x64 
    Windows.
15. (DONE) progress bar disappears when you select other drive: it's normal behaviour
16. (DONE) can analyse and defrag floppies (isn't useful but ...)
17. (DONE) report - comment column:
    [OVR] - file is over limit
    [DIR] - is directory
    [CMP] - compressed file
18. (DONE) about report - small size but very useful [should be in future] - generated 
    by driver very fast.
19. (DONE) filter: ignore files greater than: n [Kb | Mb | Gb | Tb]
20. (DONE) Debug print: normal to view useful messages about analyse / defrag progress;
    detailed to send to an author when error encountered.
21. (DONE) Virus scanner must be stopped.
