Version Control with Subversion:

    http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn-book.html

Don't set the svn:mime-type property for *.c, *.h and *.cmd files to text/plain.
Otherwise the online SVN browser at http://sourceforge.net/p/ultradefrag/code/
will fail to highlight their syntax.

To get the list of all set properties type:

svn proplist -R -v https://ultradefrag.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ultradefrag

To disable auto-props functionality for *.c, *.h and *.cmd files
in TortoiseSVN client, open Settings -> General -> Edit configuration file
and comment out the appropriate lines there.
