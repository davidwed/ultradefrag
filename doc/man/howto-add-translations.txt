;                             COPYRIGHT RULES
;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

UltraDefrag follows "Information for maintainers of GNU software"
to decide whether to assign copyright to a person or not:
http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/maintain.html#Legally-Significant

As language packs are pretty small, we consider to assign copyright
to anyone who contributed around twelve lines of text. We decided,
however, to give respect to all the remaining contributors in the
handbook, as we believe even small improvements help us advance
further.
