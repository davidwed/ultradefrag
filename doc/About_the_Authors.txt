UltraDefrag was originally written by Dmitri Arkhangelski. He is the chief 
architect.
Justin Dearing proposed the idea for the boot time scanning (native executable)
and wrote the original manual. He now maintains all the documentation for 
UltraDefrag.

Biography:

At the beginning of Dmitri's education he wrote a simple program to generate
random numbers. This work will not be published.

Later Dmitri attempted to write a gui shell for MS DOS similar to Windows
3.11, but written entirely in assembler called FSHELL! After six months of 
hard work he wrote about 50 % of the code to get this working; including  some
base libraries and startup code. The code is not portable to other CPUs (eg: PPC), 
and he believes FShell is not particularly useful, However, Dmitri has not ruled 
out the posibility of publishing the code.

Dmitri then decided to leave windows and learn more about open source
operating systems. He briefly experimented with the Amiga Research Operating
System (AROS). His conclusion was it was nice but not useful.

Then Dmitri encountered a practical problem that was of great interest to 
him . . . Disk Defragmentation. Thus UltraDefrag was born.

Biography:

Justin has been involved with computers since a young age. His first computer
was a second hand 8088 PC with 640k of ram and a 10 meg hard drive. His family
then aqquired a 486sx33, followed by a 486 DX66 which he upgraded most of the 
components.

Justin did some programming in Basic on the Apple II starting at age 9. He
later attempted to teach himself C++, but found C to his liking.

At age 18 Justin discovered Linux and FreeBSD. He experiemnted with Shell 
scripting, perl, java and of course C. He released his first Open Source 
project, Sanctum, a JAVA wrapper around bochs that he wrote with help from a
friend. The program achieved partial functionality, but was never completed.
The source is available at (https://sourceforge.net/projects/sanctum).

Justin later began working for a series of companies in IT and programming
capacities. He currently is a .NET programmer for a small company with the
title of Senior Developer.

In addition to maintaining the documentation for UltraDefrag, Justin is the 
author of PlaneDisaster.NET (http://plane-disaster.sf.net) a SQL front end 
to JetSQL (MSACCESS) and SQLite databases. He has also contributed to the 
following projects: SharpSevelop (http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/), 
Astrogrep (http://astrogrep.sourceforge.net/), SharpBarcode (http://sourceforge.net/projects/sharpbarcode/) 
and XML Copy Editor (http://xml-copy-editor.sourceforge.net/).
