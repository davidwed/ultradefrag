1. Installation from binary package

1.1 System requirements

You need Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 or Windows Vista.
Also Windows XP x64, Server 2003 x64 and Vista x64 editions supported.

1.2 Installation

To install UltraDefrag you can download ultradefrag-x.y.z.bin.xxxx.exe
from project site. In common cases xxxx must be 'i386'. If you have AMD x64
or Intel Core Duo processor and 64-bit Edition of Windows installed, xxxx 
must be 'amd64'. If you use PC with IA-64 architecture than try to download
IA64 version. It was never tested, because I don't have such kind of CPU.
Installation process is very simple. Enjoy it!

2. Installation from sources

2.1 Software requirements

You need:
a). either Microsoft C Compiler for Windows or gcc installed
    (p.a. Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 or Bloodshed Dev-C++ -
    you can find it at http://www.bloodshed.net)
    NOTE: GCC is currently unsupported!
b). Microsoft Windows DDK (I use Windows Server 2003 DDK) or ReactOS DDK
    (http://www.reactos.org)
c). NSIS compiler (http://nsis.sourceforge.net)
d). Ultimate Packer for eXecutables (upx) (http://upx.sf.net)
e). zip compressor (http://www.info-zip.org)

2.2 Building and installation

a). Download sources archive and unpack it somewhere.
b). Edit SETVARS.CMD. Environment variable NSISDIR must contain path
    to NSIS compiler, ULTRADFGVER - version of UltraDefrag program,
    etc.
c). To build UltraDefrag use BUILD.CMD. Synopsis is:

    build               in .\bin directory you find installer;
                        in .\src - sources zip-archive.

    build --install     it will install x86 program to default location
                        after build

    build {--use-winddk | --use-rosddk} {--use-msvc | --use-gcc} [--install]
			you can specify ddk and compiler

    build --clean       use it to delete all intermediate files
