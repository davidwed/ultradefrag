1. Installation from binary package

1.1 System requirements

  You need Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 
or Windows Vista. Also Windows XP x64, Server 2003 x64 and Vista x64 editions 
supported.


1.2 Installation

  To install UltraDefrag you can download ultradefrag-x.y.z.bin.xxxx.exe
from project site. In common cases xxxx must be 'i386'. If you have AMD x64
or Intel Core Duo processor and 64-bit Edition of Windows installed, xxxx 
must be 'amd64'. If you use PC with IA-64 architecture than try to download
IA64 version. It was never tested by the authors, because we don't have 
such kind of CPU.

  Installation process is very simple. Enjoy it!


2. Installation from sources

2.1 Software requirements

2.1.1 Compilation with Windows Server 2003 DDK

  The best way to build UltraDefrag is to do this using Windows Server 2003 
Driver Development Kit (DDK). You can simply download it from 
one of the locations that can be found using any web search system (e.g. Google).

  Only one disadvantage of this way is that the Windows DDK is a really 
big package (about 230 Mb). But if you have internet connection with good 
bandwidth, that's not a problem for you.


2.1.2 Compilation with MinGW

  Other interesting way to produce UltraDefrag package is to do this using MinGW.
GNU C Compiler (GCC) has one important advantage (MS C compiler don't have them) -
very strong C language standard compatibility checking. I have removed from the 
program code hundreds of small bugs using this unique ability of GCC. Only one 
disadvantage of described tool is that compiled code has greater size.
P.a. driver produced by DDK may have 22.0 Kb size, but the same driver produced 
by GCC has about 50.0 Kb.

  You can either download MinGW from http://www.mingw.org or download
MinGW Developer Studio from http://www.parinyasoft.com (about 25 Mb).

  Note that currently only i386 binaries can be produced using this way.

  VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: If you will build the dynamic libraries from the MinGW
Developer Studio, note that produced *.a files are invalid. Because I don't know
how to specify true options in Developer Studio's project file. Use makefiles
instead:

  mingw32-make Makefile.mingw


2.1.3 Compilation with Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0

  Other way to build the program is more difficult, but you don't need have 
Windows DDK for them. You can use Microsoft C compiler included in 
MS Visual Studio 6.0 (or later versions).

  In addition you need obtain a copy of ReactOS source code 
(from http://www.reactos.org) for special header files used to build the driver.

  Also you should download the following files:
- ntdll.lib from http://www.masm32.com/board/index.php?topic=2124.new
- ntoskrnl.lib + hal.lib from http://www.freewebs.com/four-f/index.htm
  (included in KmdKit package). Put these files to lib subdirectory of your
  Visual Studio installation.

  VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: The winnt.h file in visual studio 6.0 contains wrong
  definition of the NtCurrentTeb function. Therefore replace the following lines:

  #if defined(_M_ALPHA)
  #define NtCurrentTeb() ((struct _TEB *)_rdteb())
  #else
  struct _TEB *
  NtCurrentTeb(void);
  #endif

  with:

  #if defined(_M_ALPHA)
  #define NtCurrentTeb() ((struct _TEB *)_rdteb())
  #else
  struct _TEB *
  __stdcall NtCurrentTeb(void);
  #endif

  Finally, edit ultradfg.dsp file (driver project file), because they are 
references to ReactOS headers here.

  Note that currently only i386 binaries can be produced using this way.


2.1.4 Common tools

  There are a few other tools that you should have installed on your PC to
perform a full-featured build:

a). NSIS compiler (http://nsis.sourceforge.net) is used to produce installers.
    Currently I'm using NSIS v2.28.
    NOTE: In my nsisconf.nsh file (in NSIS root directory) I have 
    the following line:

          !packhdr temp.dat '"C:\WINDOWS\upx" -9 -q temp.dat'

b). Ultimate Packer for eXecutables (upx) (http://upx.sf.net) is used to
    reduce sizes of some binary modules. I'm using version 2.03w. Put the
    upx.exe file in one of the directories, specified in your PATH environment
    variable, p.a. in %windir%\system32.

c). 7-zip file archiver (http://www.7-zip.org) is used to produce 
    the source code package.

d). .NET framework v2.0.50727 or later is used to compile the 
    UltraDefrag Scheduler.NET application.

e). Perl language package for Windows. You can download it from
    http://www.activestate.com. Currently I'm using v5.8.6 to execute
    configure.pl script and to develop the Modern UltraDefrag User Interface
    (that was created for extended gui configuration abilities).

f). Doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org) is used to produce a special kind of 
    documentation from project's source files. It contains description 
    of functions and global variables dependencies and may be used p.a. for 
    removing unnecessary data fields from program's internal structures.
    Also it is helpful for any other program code cleanup.
    So, if you are programmer, this tool is highly recommended for you.

g). ROBODoc (http://www.xs4all.nl/~rfsber/Robo/robodoc.html) is used to 
    build interface documentation, that you should use as main developer
    manual. You will find here all descriptions of functions exported by 
    UltraDefrag and ZenWINX (that is a part of the Ultra Defragmenter)
    libraries, important notes about undocumented windows functions usage
    and many other aspects of the Ultra Defragmenter development.
    To build a basic version of docs, simply type:

        robodoc

    To produce more detailed developer manual, type:

        robodoc --internal

h). md5sum tool is used to generate file ultradefrag-x.y.z.MD5SUMS that
    gives you an ability to check downloaded packages integrity.
    You can download this tool from http://www.etree.org/md5com.html.


2.1.5 Software recommended for debugging purposes

  Because the main work is done by kernel mode driver, you can download 
tools described below to find program bugs. Even if you are not programmer, 
these tools may be very useful for you:

a). DebugView and other tools created by Mark Russinovich. You can download it
    from http://www.sysinternals.com. In DebugView window you can see some 
    interesting information given by driver engine: number of clusters on your 
    volumes, mft position and much more. Other useful tools are, par example, 
    WinObj (using them you can see when UltraDefrag opens his driver, creates 
    some events etc.), File Monitor and Registry Monitor.

b). PoolTag. This tool is included in Windows DDK or can be downloaded from 
    http://www.osr.com. Using this tool you can watch driver memory allocation.
    The UltraDefrag driver tag is 'ULTR'.

c). StatusToError tool included in KmdKit (see above). Input the NTSTATUS code
    given by gui, console or native app and you will become the localized error 
    description. Simple but very useful. Especially for boot time defragmentation
    errors decoding, because I can't do it at boot time.


2.1.6 Especially for mr. Random Newbe (notes for the beginners)

a). Many of described tools have small size, and you don't need high-speed
    internet connection to download their latest versions. Simply do it. 
    And enjoy!

b). If you will place tools executables in one of the directories, specified 
    in your PATH environment variable, the command execution will be very easy 
    process, because you can type commands without paths in the command prompt.


2.2 Building and installation

a). Download sources archive and unpack it somewhere.
    NOTE: Currently path must not contain spaces. If you have some ideas
          how to fix that send your report to the authors, please.
b). Configure build options by typing the following command:

    perl configure.pl

    This tool has graphical interface. Enter please correct paths to installed
    software and other options. If you prefer to use MinGW, click the button
    'Apply patch to MinGW' to replace some libraries included in MinGW
    (libntdll.a and libntoskrnl.a) with more adequate versions. Old libraries
    will be saved in files with additional suffix '.orig'.

c). To build UltraDefrag use BUILD.CMD. Synopsis is:

    build               in .\bin directory you will find installer;
                        in .\src_package - sources 7zip-archive.

    build --install     it will install x86 program to default location
                        after build

    build {--use-winddk | --use-mingw | --use-msvc} [--install]
			you can specify your favorite compiler

    build --clean       use it to delete all intermediate files

    build --help        show usage information and exit
