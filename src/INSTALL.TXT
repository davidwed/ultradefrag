1. Installation from binary package

1.1 System requirements

  UltraDefrag runs on Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server
2003 and  Windows Vista, including 64 bit versions of Windows. NT 4.0 Alpha
is not supported currently.


1.2 Installation

  To install UltraDefrag, simply download ultradefrag-x.y.z.bin.xxxx.exe
from project site. In common cases xxxx must be 'i386'. If you have AMD x64
or Intel Core Duo processor and 64-bit Edition of Windows installed, xxxx 
must be 'amd64'. If you use PC with IA-64 architecture then try to download
IA64 version. The IA-64 build is untested because the authors lack access to
IA-64 bit hardware. We would like to hear reports of attempts to run.

  The installation process is very simple. Enjoy!


2. Installation from sources

2.1 Software requirements

2.1.1 Compilation with Windows Server 2003 DDK

  The best way to build UltraDefrag is to use the Windows Server 2003 Driver
Development Kit (DDK). You can simply download it from one of the locations
that can be found using any web search system (e.g. Google).

  The only disadvantage of this method is that the Windows DDK is a really 
big package (about 230 Mb). However, if you have an internet connection with 
a good download rate, its should not be a large problem.


2.1.2 Compilation with MinGW

  Other interesting way to produce UltraDefrag package is to do so using MinGW.
GNU C Compiler (GCC) has one important advantage over the Microsoft C
compiler, it produces many useful warnings for code that is not completely
within the C standard. I have removed hundreds of small bugs from UltraDefrag
thanks to the warnings produced by GCC. The biggest disadvantage of gcc is that 
it produces larger executables than the microsoft compiler. e.g: A driver
produced by DDK may have 22.0 Kb size, but the same driver produced by GCC is
only about 32.0 kb.

  You can either download MinGW from http://www.mingw.org or download
MinGW Developer Studio from http://www.parinyasoft.com (about 25 Mb).

  Note that the MinGW build system can only build i386 binaries.

  VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: If you build the dynamic libraries from the MinGW
Developer Studio, the resulting *.a files are invalid. This is because I don't
know how to specify linker options in Developer Studio's project file. Use
makefiles instead:

  mingw32-make Makefile.mingw


2.1.3 Compilation with Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0

  This is another method for building UltraDefrag. It does not require the
DDK. You can use Microsoft C compiler included in MS Visual Studio version 6.0
or later.

  To use this method you will need to obtain a copy of ReactOS source code
from http://www.reactos.org for special header files used to build the driver.

  You will also need to download the following files:
- ntdll.lib from http://www.masm32.com/board/index.php?topic=2124.new
- ntoskrnl.lib + hal.lib from http://www.freewebs.com/four-f/index.htm
  (included in KmdKit package). Put these files to lib subdirectory of your
  Visual Studio installation.

  VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: The winnt.h file in visual studio 6.0 contains an
incorrect definition of the NtCurrentTeb function. Therefore replace the
following lines:

  #if defined(_M_ALPHA)
  #define NtCurrentTeb() ((struct _TEB *)_rdteb())
  #else
  struct _TEB *
  NtCurrentTeb(void);
  #endif

  with:

  #if defined(_M_ALPHA)
  #define NtCurrentTeb() ((struct _TEB *)_rdteb())
  #else
  struct _TEB *
  __stdcall NtCurrentTeb(void);
  #endif

  Finally, edit ultradfg.dsp file (driver project file), and ensure that the
reactos header paths are properly set.

  Note that currently only i386 binaries can be produced using this way.


2.1.4 Common tools

  There are a few other tools that you should have installed on your PC to
perform a full-featured build:

a). NSIS compiler (http://nsis.sourceforge.net) is used to produce installers.
    Currently I'm using NSIS v2.28.
    NOTE: In my nsisconf.nsh file (in NSIS root directory) I have 
    the following line:

          !packhdr temp.dat '"C:\WINDOWS\upx" -9 -q temp.dat'

b). Ultimate Packer for eXecutables (upx) (http://upx.sf.net) is used to
    reduce sizes of some binary modules. I'm using version 2.03w. Put the
    upx.exe file in one of the directories, specified in your PATH environment
    variable, p.a. in %windir%\system32.

c). 7-zip file archiver (http://www.7-zip.org) is used to produce 
    the source code package.

d). .NET framework v2.0.50727 or later is used to compile the 
    UltraDefrag Scheduler.NET application.

e). Perl language package for Windows. You can download it from
    http://www.activestate.com. Currently I'm using v5.8.6 to execute
    configure.pl script and to develop the Modern UltraDefrag User Interface
    (that was created for extended gui configuration abilities).

f). Doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org) is used to produce a special kind of 
    documentation from project's source files. It contains descriptions 
    of functions and global variables dependencies and may be used e.g. for
    removing unnecessary data fields from program's internal structures.
    Also it is helpful for any other program code cleanup.
    So, if you are programmer, this tool is highly recommended for you.

g). ROBODoc (http://www.xs4all.nl/~rfsber/Robo/robodoc.html) is used to 
    build interface documentation, that you should use as main developer
    manual. You will find here all descriptions of functions exported by 
    UltraDefrag and ZenWINX (that is a part of the Ultra Defragmenter)
    libraries, important notes about undocumented windows functions usage
    and many other aspects of the Ultra Defragmenter development.
    To build a basic version of docs, simply type:

        robodoc

    To produce more detailed developer manual, type:

        robodoc --internal

h). md5sum tool is used to generate file ultradefrag-x.y.z.MD5SUMS that
    gives you an ability to check downloaded packages integrity.
    You can download this tool from http://www.etree.org/md5com.html.

i). Lua language binaries package is used to execute some build scripts.
    You can download it from http://luabinaries.luaforge.net/.
    Install it in some folder on your %PATH% and rename lua5.1.exe to lua.exe.


2.1.5 Software recommended for debugging purposes

  Because the actual work done by UltraDefrag is done by kernel mode driver,
you can download the tools described below to troubleshoot bugs. Even if you
are not programmer, these tools may be very useful for you:

a). DebugView. You can download it and other tools created by Mark Russinovich
    from http://www.sysinternals.com. In DebugView window you can see some 
    interesting information given by driver engine: number of clusters on your 
    volumes, mft position and much more. Some other useful tools available from
    sysinternals are
    - WinObj: Allows you to see when UltraDefrag opens its driver, creates 
    some events etc.
    - File Monitor
    - Registry Monitor.

b). PoolTag. This tool is included in Windows DDK or can be downloaded from 
    http://www.osr.com. Using this tool you can watch driver memory allocation.
    The UltraDefrag driver tag is 'ULTR'.

c). StatusToError tool included in KmdKit (see above). Input the NTSTATUS code
    given by the UltraDefrag gui, console or native app and it will give you
    the localized error description. A simple but very useful tool, especially 
    for boot time defragmentation errors, where it is impossible for the
    program to do localization lookups.


2.1.6 Especially for Mr. Random Newbe (Some notes for the beginners)

a). Many of described tools have small size, and you don't need high-speed
    internet connection to download their latest versions. Simply do it. 
    And enjoy!

b). If you will place tools executables in one of the directories, specified 
    in your PATH environment variable, the command execution will be very easy 
    process, because you can type commands without paths in the command prompt.


2.2 Building and installation

a). Download source archive and unpack it somewhere.
    NOTE: Currently path must not contain spaces. If you have some ideas
          how to fix that send your report to the authors, please.
b). Configure build options by typing the following command:

    perl configure.pl

    This tool has a graphical interface. Enter the paths to prerequisite
    libraries and other options. If you prefer to use MinGW, click the button
    'Apply patch to MinGW' to replace some libraries included in MinGW
    (libntdll.a and libntoskrnl.a) with more adequate versions. Old libraries
    will be saved in files with additional suffix '.orig'.

c). To build UltraDefrag use the BUILD.CMD script; parameters are:

    build               in .\bin directory you will find installer;
                        in .\src_package - sources 7zip-archive.

    build --install     it will install x86 program to default location
                        after build

    build {--use-winddk | --use-mingw | --use-msvc} [--install]
			you can specify your compiler of choice

    build --clean       use it to delete all intermediate files

    build --help        show usage information and exit

d). To build UltraDefrag Micro Edition package use the build-micro.cmd scipt.
    It has the same options that build.cmd has. After a successfull 
    compilation you will have ready to use binary packages, but the source 
    code archive will not be produced (to increase the compilation speed).
    To make an archive of sources run build.cmd script.
