Frequently Asked Questions

Q.: I have 3 Gb of RAM, but in Debug Output I find message 'No enough memory'.
    I have 150 millions clusters on volume.

A.: You have too much clusters on specified volume. Par example, you have 
    150 millions of clusters. Therefore, you must have more than 150 Mb of 
    nonpaged memory. But all of the supported versions of Windows 
    (at least 2000, XP, 2003) give you maximum 256 Mb of this kind of memory.
    In addition, if you use boot parameter /3GB limit is 128 Mb.
    Note that many drivers use nonpaged memory, not only ultradfg.sys!
 
    There are few ways how YOU can fix this problem:
    1. increase cluster size of volume – it’s the best thing.
    2. buy new PC with x64 architecture, setup Windows x64 edition and enjoy.
       Because on x64 you can have 128 Gb of nonpaged memory.
    3. split your big volume into several small volumes
       and therefore process parts separately.


Q.: How can I use filters?

A.: The include field is where you enter substring expressions that match
    file names (incl. path) that you want to defragment. And the exclude field
    expressions disable defragmentation of matching files. You can enter 
    multiple expressions, separating each with a semicolon (;).
    In next field named 'Ignore files greater than' you can specify size limit
    of files. P.a.: 12 Mb.


Q.: I've seen message "Can't load ultradfg driver!" on Windows Vista. I think 
    that Vista prevents loading because driver signature check is enabled.
    How can I disable it?

A.: Christopher Naegel give you following instructions:
    1. Open a command line with admin-rights:
          Start -> execute -> CMD (with admin rights).
    2. Type:
          bcdedit /set loadoptions ”DDISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS”
          bcdedit /set nointegritychecks ON
    3. Close command line and start group policy editor:
          Start -> execute -> gpedit.msc
    4. go to:
          user configuration -> administrative templates -> System ->
          driver installation -> Code signing for device drivers
    5. enable this policy and set it to Ignore state.
