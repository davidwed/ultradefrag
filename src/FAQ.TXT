Frequently Asked Questions

Q.: How can I use filters?

A.: The include field is where you enter substring expressions that match
    file names (incl. path) that you want to defragment. And the exclude field
    expressions disable defragmentation of matching files. You can enter 
    multiple expressions, separating each with a semicolon (;).
    The next field in the form is captioned 'Ignore files greater than.' Files
    over this size are not dedragmented. You may specify sizes with the following 
    suffixes: (Kb | Mb | Gb | Tb).

Q.: I've seen message "Can't load ultradfg driver!" on Windows Vista. I think 
    that Vista is preventing this driver from loading because the signature
    check is enabled.  How can I disable it?

A.: Thanks to Christopher Naegel for providing the following instructions:
    1. Open a command line with admin-rights:
          Start -> execute -> CMD (with admin rights).
    2. Type:
          bcdedit /set loadoptions "DDISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS"
          bcdedit /set nointegritychecks ON
    3. Close the command prompt and start group policy editor:
          Start -> execute -> gpedit.msc
    4. Go to:
          User Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> System ->
          Driver Installation -> Code Signing for device drivers
    5. Enable this policy and set it to Ignore state.
