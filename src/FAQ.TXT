Frequently Asked Questions

Q.: I have 3 Gb of RAM, but the Debug Output includes the message 'No enough memory'.
    I have 150 millions clusters on the volume I am trying to defrag.

A.: You have too many clusters on the specified volume.  Since you have 
    150 millions of clusters, you must have more than 150 Mb of 
    nonpaged memory. All versions of Windows that UltraDefrag run on (at least 
    Windows 2000, XP, and 2003) allow a maximum of 256 Mb of nonpaged memory.
    In addition, if you use boot parameter /3GB limit is 128 Mb.
    Note that many drivers besides ultradfg.sys use nonpaged memory!
 
    There are few ways how YOU, the user, can fix this problem:
    1. Increase cluster size of volume. This is probably a good idea for
       performance reasons.
    2. Buy new PC with a 64 bit processor, and install a 64 bit version of
       Windows. 64 bit versions of WIndows support up to 128 Gb of nonpaged
       memory.
    3. Split your big volume into several smaller partitions. Each partition 
       will have less clusters.


Q.: How can I use filters?

A.: The include field is where you enter substring expressions that match
    file names (incl. path) that you want to defragment. And the exclude field
    expressions disable defragmentation of matching files. You can enter 
    multiple expressions, separating each with a semicolon (;).
    The next field in the form is captioned 'Ignore files greater than.' Files
    over this size are not dedragmented. You may specify sizes with the following 
    suffixes: (Kb | Mb | Gb | Tb),

Q.: I've seen message "Can't load ultradfg driver!" on Windows Vista. I think 
    that Vista is preventing this driver from loading because the signature
    check is enabled.  How can I disable it?

A.: Thanks to Christopher Naegel for providing the following instructions:
    1. Open a command line with admin-rights:
          Start -> execute -> CMD (with admin rights).
    2. Type:
          bcdedit /set loadoptions "DDISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS"
          bcdedit /set nointegritychecks ON
    3. Close the command prompt and start group policy editor:
          Start -> execute -> gpedit.msc
    4. Go to:
          User Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> System ->
          Driver Installation -> Code Signing for device drivers
    5. Enable this policy and set it to Ignore state.
