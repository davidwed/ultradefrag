 *
 * All new versions of Windows denies the kernel mode drivers loading
 * if they have no digital signature. Therefore you must disable the
 * driver signature checks to successfully load the UltraDefrag driver.
 * There are at least three ways of doing that:
 * - Press F8 button on Windows startup and choose Disable driver 
 *   signature verification menu item. You should do these steps after 
 *   each reboot to have an ability to load the driver.
 * - <a href="http://www.citadelindustries.net/readydriverplus/index.php">ReadyDriver Plus</a> 
 *   program automates F8 key pressing on Windows startup and selecting an appropriate menu item.
 * - <a href="http://www.ngohq.com/home.php?page=dseo">Driver Signature Enforcement Overrider</a>
 *   program may be used to digitally sign the driver (ultradfg.sys).
