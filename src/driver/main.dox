 * <h2>Introduction</h2>
 * UltraDefrag kernel mode driver was built primarily for educational
 * purposes. To practically discover the Windows kernel architecture.
 * Later I noticed that the driver gives me a lot of problems. It may 
 * easily cause BSOD, it is difficult to load them on Vista and later
 * versions of Windows. Hence I decided to write a separate user mode
 * driver (DLL) to replace it.
 *
 * Regardless of its practical helpfulness, the kernel mode driver 
 * still has an educational meaning. It may be used for a large set of
 * interesting experiments.
 *
 * This automatically generated documentation will not contain detailed
 * information about internal driver functions, because the main goal is
 * to make a cross-referenced set of pages representing the global internal
 * structure of the driver. I hope, it may help everyone to understand how
 * the driver works.
 *
 * <h2>Vista installation guide</h2>
 * If you have decided to use the kernel mode driver on Vista or any later
 * version of Windows, read instructions provided @ref Vista "here" to disable
 * the driver signature checks. Otherwise Windows will deny drivers loading.
 *
 * <h2>Kernel mode driver debugging</h2>
 * Detailed instructions for non-technical users are @ref Debug "here".
