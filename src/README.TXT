UltraDefrag Version 1.1.0
Updated Aug 16th, 2007
=========================

1. What is UltraDefrag?

   UltraDefrag is a powerful Open Source defragmentation utility for Windows
NT 4.0 and later operating systems.  It is very fast, because the defragmenting
is done by kernel-mode driver. They are three interfaces to them: graphical,
console and native.  The GUI is very useful, because visually represents your
filesystem as a color coded cluster  map. The console is another option for 
those that prefer the command line.  It is also benificial in that it can be 
run in the task scheduler. 
Finally, the native executable will run at boot time in a manner similar to 
chkdsk.

   The design of UltraDefrag is very simple. There are no skins, localization, 
or animations. It is a small and powerful program!

   It can be used on Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 
2003, Windows Vista and all of the 64-bit editions of Windows.

   You must have administrative rights to install and use UltraDefrag.
