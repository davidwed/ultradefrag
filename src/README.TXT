The Ultra Defragmenter Version 3.2.0
------------------------------------

Ultra Defragmenter is a powerful Open Source defragmentation utility for 
Windows NT 4.0 and later operating systems. It is very fast, because the 
defragmenting is done by kernel-mode driver. They are three interfaces to 
them: graphical, console and native. The GUI is very useful, because 
visually represents your filesystem as a color coded cluster map. The 
console is another option for those that prefer the command line. It is
also benificial in that it can be run in the task scheduler. Finally, 
the native executable will run at boot time in a manner similar to chkdsk.

The design of Ultra Defragmenter is very simple. There are no skins and other 
unnecessary stuff. It is a small and powerful program!

It can be used on Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 
2003, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7 and all of the 64-bit 
editions of Windows.
