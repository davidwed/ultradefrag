1. Installation from binary package

1.1 System requirements

  You need Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 
or Windows Vista. Also Windows XP x64, Server 2003 x64 and Vista x64 editions 
supported.


1.2 Installation

Download source archive and unpack it somewhere. Use dll and lib files 
compiled for your target processor architecture and header file zenwinx.h


2. Installation from sources

2.1 Software requirements

2.1.1 Compilation with Windows Server 2003 DDK

  The best way to build ZenWINX is to do this using Windows Server 2003 
Driver Development Kit (DDK). You can simply download it from 
one of the locations that can be found using any web search system (e.g. Google).

  Only one disadvantage of this way is that the Windows DDK is a really 
big package (about 230 Mb). But if you have internet connection with good 
bandwidth, that's not a problem for you.


2.1.2 Compilation with MinGW

  Other interesting way to produce ZenWINX package is to do this using MinGW.
GNU C Compiler (GCC) has one important advantage (MS C compiler don't have them) -
very strong C language standard compatibility checking. I have removed from the 
program code hundreds of small bugs using this unique ability of GCC. Only one 
disadvantage of described tool is that compiled code has greater size.

  You can either download MinGW from http://www.mingw.org or download
MinGW Developer Studio from http://www.parinyasoft.com (about 25 Mb).

  Note that currently only i386 binaries can be produced using this way.

  VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: If you will build the dynamic libraries from the MinGW
Developer Studio, note that produced *.a files are invalid. Because I don't know
how to specify true options in Developer Studio's project file. Use makefiles
instead:

  mingw32-make Makefile.mingw


2.1.3 Compilation with Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0

  Other way to build the library is more difficult. You can use Microsoft C 
  compiler included in MS Visual Studio 6.0 (or later versions).

  Also you should download the ntdll.lib file from 
  http://www.masm32.com/board/index.php?topic=2124.new

  VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: The winnt.h file in visual studio 6.0 contains wrong
  definition of the NtCurrentTeb function. Therefore replace the following lines:

  #if defined(_M_ALPHA)
  #define NtCurrentTeb() ((struct _TEB *)_rdteb())
  #else
  struct _TEB *
  NtCurrentTeb(void);
  #endif

  with:

  #if defined(_M_ALPHA)
  #define NtCurrentTeb() ((struct _TEB *)_rdteb())
  #else
  struct _TEB *
  __stdcall NtCurrentTeb(void);
  #endif

  Without this you can't build the zenwinx library!

  Note that currently only i386 binaries can be produced using this way.


2.1.4 Common tools

  There are a few other tools that you should have installed on your PC to
perform a full-featured build:

a). 7-zip file archiver (http://www.7-zip.org) is used to produce 
    the source code package.

b). Perl language package for Windows. You can download it from
    http://www.activestate.com. Currently I'm using v5.8.6 to execute
    zen-configure.pl script.

c). Doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org) is used to produce a special kind of 
    documentation from project's source files. It contains description 
    of functions and global variables dependencies and may be used p.a. for 
    removing unnecessary data fields from program's internal structures.
    Also it is helpful for any other program code cleanup.
    So, if you are programmer, this tool is highly recommended for you.

d). ROBODoc (http://www.xs4all.nl/~rfsber/Robo/robodoc.html) is used to 
    build interface documentation, that you should use as main developer
    manual. You will find here all descriptions of functions exported by 
    ZenWINX, important notes about undocumented windows functions usage
    and many other aspects of the ZenWINX development.
    To build a basic version of docs, simply type:

        robodoc

    To produce more detailed developer manual, type:

        robodoc --internal

e). md5sum tool is used to generate file zenwinx-x.y.z.md5 that
    gives you an ability to check downloaded package integrity.
    You can download this tool from http://www.etree.org/md5com.html.


2.2 Building and installation

a). Download sources archive and unpack it somewhere.
    NOTE: Currently path must not contain spaces. If you have some ideas
          how to fix that send your report to the authors, please.
b). Configure build options by typing the following command:

    perl zen-configure.pl

    This tool has graphical interface. Enter please correct paths to installed
    software and other options. If you prefer to use MinGW, click the button
    'Apply patch to MinGW' to replace some libraries included in MinGW
    (libntdll.a and libntoskrnl.a) with more adequate versions. Old libraries
    will be saved in files with additional suffix '.orig'.

c). To build ZenWINX use BUILD_ZENWINX.CMD. Synopsis is:

    build_zenwinx               in .\src_package you will find 
                                sources 7zip-archive

    build_zenwinx --install     it will put x86 library in %windir%\system32
                                directory after build

    build_zenwinx {--use-winddk | --use-mingw | --use-msvc} [--install]
                                you can specify your favorite compiler

    build_zenwinx --clean       use it to delete all intermediate files

    build_zenwinx --help        show usage information and exit
