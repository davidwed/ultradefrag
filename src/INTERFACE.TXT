How do I communicate with the UltraDefrag engine?

1). Load device driver.
2). Open device \\.\ultradfg
3). Make a write request. You must send structure ULTRADFG_COMMAND,
    described in ultradfg.h. All fields must be valid. Requests
    (command field) are 'a' (analyse), 'd' (defragment) and 'c' 
    (compact).
4). If you use synchronous api, the request will return only when it's done.
    If the asynchronous version of api used, you can send DeviceIoControl
    requests while the engine is still working.
5). To get information about the volume and defragmentation process you must 
    use DeviceIoControl requests. They are:

    IOCTL_GET_STATISTIC
    Input: nothing. Output: STATISTIC structure.

    IOCTL_GET_CLUSTER_MAP
    Input: nothing. Output: UCHAR array for cluster map.

    IOCTL_SET_INCLUDE_FILTER
    Input: WCHAR string of semicolon separated words. Output: nothing.

    IOCTL_SET_EXCLUDE_FILTER
    Input: WCHAR string of semicolon separated words. Output: nothing.
6). To stop analyse / defrag / compact send special IoControl request:

    IOCTL_ULTRADEFRAG_STOP
    Input: nothing. Output: nothing.
7). Before you exit close the device handle.
8). Unload the driver.
