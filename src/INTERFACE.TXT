How to communicate with UltraDefrag engine?

1). Load driver.
2). Open device \\.\ultradfg
3). Make write request. You must send structure ULTRADFG_COMMAND,
    described in ultradfg.h. All fields must be valid. Requests
    (command field) are 'a' (analyse), 'd' (defragment) and 'c' 
    (compact).
4). If you use synchronous api, request will return only when it's done.
    If asynchronous version of api used, you can send DeviceIoControl
    requests while engine work.
5). To get information about volume and defragmentation process you must 
    use DeviceIoControl requests. They are:

    IOCTL_GET_STATISTIC
    Input: nothing. Output: STATISTIC structure.

    IOCTL_GET_CLUSTER_MAP
    Input: nothing. Output: UCHAR array for cluster map.

    IOCTL_SET_INCLUDE_FILTER
    Input: WCHAR string of semicolon separated words. Output: nothing.

    IOCTL_SET_EXCLUDE_FILTER
    Input: WCHAR string of semicolon separated words. Output: nothing.
6). To stop analyse / defrag / compact send special IoControl request:

    IOCTL_ULTRADEFRAG_STOP
    Input: nothing. Output: nothing.
7). Before exit close device handle.
8). Unload driver.
