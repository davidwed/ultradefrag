HISTORY

  Version 3.3.1  2010-01-
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - few extremely important bugs were fixed
    - program is available again for all 64-bit targets
    - translations submitting is available again through project's forum 
      which works much better that MediaWiki service used before
    - USB keyboards support at Windows boot time was added
    - error handling was highly improved
    - kernel mode driver was removed as a component less reliable by definition
    - handbook was rewritten to be much clearer
    - all important program sources were well documented


  Beta Stage
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    All versions listed below were treated as stable and so on, but actually 
    they were highly unreliable. Program's internal structure is very complex, 
    it uses a lot of undocumented Windows calls. Therefore bug hunting was
    always extremely hard, especially in early days when an author had 
    no enough experience.

    In other words, all versions prior to 3.3.1 must be treated as products 
    of the beta stage of program's development.


  Version 3.3.0  2009-12-04
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - volume optimization algorithm was highly improved
    - fragments threshold filter parameter was added
    - UD_TIME_LIMIT option was added
    - portable version was highly improved
    - few little bugs were fixed
    - now the program is much more compatible with Vista and later versions 
      of Windows; this is achieved by adding the User Mode Driver to it
    - program's reliability increased by removing error handlers caused 
      infinite loops
    - now the program can be used in Windows Safe Mode when the user mode 
      driver is enabled

    - since this version native 64-bit binaries aren't available
      due to the C compilers internal bugs (Windows DDK, Windows SDK, Pelles C, 
      MinGW x64 were tested); portable UltraDefrag can be used now on all of the  
      64-bit systems instead of the native 64-bit packages

    - NOTE FOR PROGRAMMERS: to successfully compile the user mode driver run 
      configure.lua script, check 'Apply patch to MinGW' box and click OK 
      once again


  Version 3.2.1  2009-10-06

      approximately 25 times faster now
    - defragmentaion of additional streams attached to NTFS files was added

      statistics and cluster map; these files are completely ignored now

    - the \??\ sequence removed from file names in reports
    - Thai translation was made

    - ability to translate Scheduler into foreign languages was added
    - GUI options were moved from udefrag-gui.cmd script to 
      easy to understand guiopts.lua file
    - debugging information will not be saved on disk since this version of the 
      program; read carefully an appropriate chapter of program's handbook for 
      detailed instructions about kernel mode driver debugging instead
    - few fatal driver bugs were fixed
    - driver's reliability was increased
    - now UltraDefrag requires less software for its development
    - FOR PROGRAMMERS: build configurator was rewritten in Lua
    - NOTE FOR PROGRAMMERS: to successfully recompile the driver run 
      configure.pl script and click 'Apply patch to MinGW' button once again
