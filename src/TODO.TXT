; Plans for future:
;
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Add UD_FRAGMENTS_THRESHOLD filter parameter.
2. Improve filters by excluding more files.
3. Add full support for USB keyboards and PS/2 keyboards on x64 systems.

After these 3 steps program goes into maintenance mode. New releases will 
contain new language packs, bugfixes (when some bugs will be reported) and 
improvements (when something interesting will be suggested). Also we will 
continue to provide technical support to program users.

All the features non listed above but suggested by users are in our opinion 
optional features. Their implementation seems to be too difficult though 
the result seems to be not so great. Maybe we will implement some things 
in future, but this is not a main goal for next days.

We have one better thing to do in future: UltraDefrag for DOS seems to be 
a really cool software, useful for these gamers who prefers old good games 
written especially for DOS.

To get more information about UltraDefrag for DOS check out the /src/DOS 
subdirectory contents of our SVN repository.

Thanks for comprehension.
