They were tested Windows DDK with all available optimization keys (including /Od), 
latest Windows SDK, Pelles C compiler and MinGW x64. Unfortunately each of them 
produces wrong x64 code. Therefore we cannot provide 64-bit native binaries 
at this moment.

Since the 3.3.0 release we'll provide two different forms of binaries:
 - full featured 32-bit packages (with kernel mode driver and boot time interface)
 - portable packages

Portable packages will be native 32-bit, therefore kernel mode driver and boot 
time interface will not be available on 64-bit systems. On the other hand, 
all remaining features of the program will be well supported. In addition, 
portable packages will not require installation, which is another advantage over 
an old portable packages.

x64 compiler included in Windows Server 2003 DDK sometimes produces 
wrong code. We need to find better replacement for it.

DOS version development is a little bit difficult due to the missing universal 
sectors reading function in this operating system. Therefore we will develop it 
under an experimental basis when we will have free time enough for that. I'm 
not sure that it will be particularly useful.

Instead of working on separate DOS version of the program I plan to complete 
the final 3.2.x Windows version. This point will be achieved for educational 
purposes: the final version of the driver will be helpful for all the people 
who are interested in Windows Kernel architecture.

After achieving this final point I'll work on a driver replacement. All kernel 
mode code will be ported to a single native DLL. This gives us the following 
advantages: better support for modern versions of Windows regards to solving 
a driver signing problem, better reliability and more simplified code.

First of all I will port all defragmenter's code to a single udefrag-kernel.dll.
Later I'll perform full set of tests to compare it with driver.

; Plans for future (7 October 2009):
;
;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Add UD_FRAGMENTS_THRESHOLD filter parameter.
2. Improve filters by excluding more files.
3. Add full support for USB keyboards and PS/2 keyboards on x64 systems.

After these 3 steps program goes into maintenance mode. New releases will 
contain new language packs, bugfixes (when some bugs will be reported) and 
improvements (when something interesting will be suggested). Also we will 
continue to provide technical support to program users.

All the features non listed above but suggested by users are in our opinion 
optional features. Their implementation seems to be too difficult though 
the result seems to be not so great. Maybe we will implement some things 
in future, but this is not a main goal for next days.

We have one better thing to do in future: UltraDefrag for DOS seems to be 
a really cool software, useful for these gamers who prefers old good games 
written especially for DOS.

To get more information about UltraDefrag for DOS check out the /src/DOS 
subdirectory contents of our SVN repository.

Thanks for comprehension.
