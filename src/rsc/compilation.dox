/**
 * @page Compilation Compilation
 *
 * To compile UltraDefrag from sources you need first of all decide
 * which compiler to use. There are few different compilers supported
 * at this moment, including GCC (in <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW environment</a>),
 * Microsoft C compiler (in MS Visual Studio 6.0 environment) and 
 * <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/0/f/90f019ac-8243-48d3-91cf-81fc4093ecfd/1830_usa_ddk.iso" 
 * title="DDK for Windows Server 2003 SP1 (231MB CD-ISO-Image)">Windows Server
 * 2003 DDK</a>. The first two compilers are easier to use while the last one
 * is a single choice when you need to compile binaries for all of the
 * supported processor architectures.
 *
 * Both MinGW and MS Visual Studio need to be patched to be able
 * to compile UltraDefrag. Type <b>build --help</b> (see below)
 * for details.
 *
 * Regardless of the selected compiler you need to setup few other little
 * tools on your system:
 *
 * - <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/">NSIS compiler</a>
 * - <a href="http://luabinaries.luaforge.net/">Lua</a>, 
 * <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/iup/files/">IUP</a>, 
 * <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/canvasdraw/files/">CD</a>
 * - <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip file archiver</a>
 * - <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/">Doxygen</a>
 * - <a href="http://www.etree.org/md5com.html">md5sum tool</a>
 * 
 * All listed packages can be downloaded from 
 * <a href="http://ultradefrag.sourceforge.net/devtools/">UltraDefrag web site</a>.
 * Install NSIS and 7-zip. Extract all others to some directory on your \%PATH\%,
 * e.g. to C:\\Windows.
 *
 * Also we use <a href="http://upx.sf.net/">UPX</a> to reduce size of installers.
 * The following command should be included in nsisconf.nsh file:
@verbatim
!packhdr temp.dat '"C:\WINDOWS\upx" --best -q temp.dat'
@endverbatim
 *
 * To properly set up the build environment type:
 * @code lua configure.lua @endcode
 * @image html config.lua.png
 *
 * To build UltraDefrag using defaults type:
 * @code build @endcode
 *
 * To list all of the supported options type:
 * @code build --help @endcode
 *
 * To select one of the predefined build actions type:
 * @code build-menu @endcode
 *
 * If you'd like to know, how the build process works, look at .cmd files -
 * they contain the complete information.
 *
 * If you are using MinGW Developer Studio, note that you cannot
 * build proper .a files directly from IDE. So, when you change some
 * DLL entries, you need to rebuild all to make these changes visible
 * from other modules.
