/**
 * @page Compilation Compilation
 *
 * <h2>Software requirements</h2>
 * - <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">GNU C Compiler</a>
 * - <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/">NSIS compiler</a>
 * - <a href="http://luabinaries.luaforge.net/">Lua</a>, 
 * <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/iup/files/">IUP</a>, 
 * <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/canvasdraw/files/">CD</a>
 * - <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip file archiver</a>
 * - <a href="http://www.info-zip.org/">Zip file archiver</a>
 * - <a href="http://www.doxygen.org/">Doxygen</a>
 * - <a href="http://www.etree.org/md5com.html">md5sum tool</a>
 *
 * You may download all listed tools from 
 * <a href="http://ultradefrag.sourceforge.net/devtools/">this location</a>.
 * In case when the installer is provided for an appropriate tool, 
 * just install it. Otherwise unpack provided archive into any directory, 
 * specified in your path environment variable. If you are in trouble, 
 * just unpack archives to C:\\WINDOWS, in other words, in folder where 
 * you have Windows installed.
 *
 * If you are using the latest version of MinGW, don't be surprised when 
 * <b>undefined reference to __strtod</b> error message appears during the 
 * compilation. This is because the following 
 * <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1956337&group_id=2435&atid=302435">patch</a>
 * applied to MinGW is incompatible with msvcrt.dll library which is used by the Ultra 
 * Defragmenter. We hope this mistake will be resolved in future by MinGW team.
 *
 * A primary use of GCC is conditioned by its stability. For 64-bit compilation
 * we are using the Microsoft C compiler included in Windows Server 2003 DDK.
 *
 * When you build dynamic libraries from the MinGW Developer Studio, note that the resulting 
 * *.a files are invalid. This is because I don't know how to specify linker options properly
 * in Developer Studio's project files.
 *
 * You can also use the Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 for the compilation, though
 * this way is obsolete and much more complicated. Download UltraDefrag sources
 * for some earlier version (approx. 3.3.0) to find detailed instructions there.
 *
 * To achieve better compression we are using also <a href="http://upx.sf.net/">UPX</a> to
 * compress an installer by adding the following line to nsisconf.nsh file:
@verbatim
!packhdr temp.dat '"C:\WINDOWS\upx" -9 -q temp.dat'
@endverbatim
 *
 * This command is optional, but it really reduces the size of the installer.
 *
 * <h2>Building and installation</h2>
 * First of all, download sources archive and unpack it somewhere 
 * (path must not contain spaces). Than configure the build options by typing
 * the following command:
 * @code lua configure.lua @endcode
 * Enter the paths to development tools and other options here. If you prefer 
 * to use MinGW, check also the Apply patch to MinGW box and click OK
 * to replace libntdll.a and libntoskrnl.a libraries included in MinGW
 * with more adequate versions. Replaced files will be saved with an additional
 * suffix '.orig'.
 *
 * @image html config.lua.png
 *
 * The screenshot above represents only the actual options which gives us the best 
 * compilation result. To configure all available options, including obsolete and
 * experimental, type:
 * @code lua configure.lua --all @endcode
 *
 * There are four different build commands:
 * - <b>build</b> for a full-featured installers and sources package
 * - <b>build-micro</b> for the Micro Edition installer
 * - <b>build-portable</b> for the UltraDefrag Portable package
 * - <b>build-micro-portable</b> for the Portable Micro Edition package
 *
 * To build UltraDefrag type:
 * @code build @endcode
 *
 * To display list of available build options type:
 * @code build --help @endcode
 *
 * If you have any questions regarding details of the build process, just look at 
 * appropriate script contents. Sure you'll find an answer.
