/**
 * @page Design Design Notes
 *
 * The Ultra Defragmenter consists of more than 10 different modules.
 *
 * @image html udscheme.png
 *
 * At the bottom level we have two drivers. Kernel mode driver which is 
 * obsolete and user mode driver. Both modules does the same job, though 
 * we have no plans to add new algorithms to the old driver in future.
 *
 * Udefrag.dll library is a thin middle layer between drivers and user
 * interfaces. A little set of functions contained there highly simplifies
 * development.
 *
 * ZenWINX is a framework for the Windows native development. The complete
 * documentation for it is <a href="http://zenwinx.sourceforge.net">here</a>.
 *
 * Over the described modules are built three user interfaces.
 *
 * The report converter written in Lua is used by GUI to produce the HTML-formatted
 * reports. Lua is used here because it is extremely reliable and has a good 
 * support for the string processing.
 *
 * The report sorting engine embedded in HTML-reports is written in JavaScript.
 *
 * Also UltraDefrag contains one special library which simplifies graphical
 * interfaces development. Its name is WGX (Windows GUI Extended).
 * GUI Configurator and Scheduler are another two programs which utilizes the 
 * WGX library.
 *
 * UltraDefrag installer is written in NSIS.
